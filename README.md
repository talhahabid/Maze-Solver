# Maze Solver

This project implements a maze solver in Java. The program reads a maze from a file and uses recursion to find the path from the start (`S`) to the end (`E`). It marks the path with `'-'` and backtracks with `'X'` when it encounters a dead-end.

- **Maze Representation**:
  - `'X'`: Wall
  - `'O'`: Open Path
  - `'S'`: Start Point
  - `'E'`: End Point
  - `'-'`: Path Taken
